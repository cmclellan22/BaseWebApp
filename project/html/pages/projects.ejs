        <h3>Spootify</h3>
        <p>Everyone's favorite mystical music app. I learned so much about desktop applications and also making a product that lots of people like to get really aggressive about when they compare it to lesser services like Rdio (rip). Spootify changed the whole world and make iTunes look like trash and also saved people a lot of money and time when it got them to stop downloading music.</p>
